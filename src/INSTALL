Installation instructions
-------------------------
You can just type './rxcontrol' to start it, or you may start rxcontrol from 
init. Just add something like the following in /etc/inittab:

rx:234:respawn:/home/sivann/develop/rxcontrol/rxcontrol

Make sure that you have commented out the getty to virtual console 5 (or
any virtual console specified in rxcontrol.conf) if rxcontrol is compiled 
with -DCHVT

For automounter support, make a link to the cdrom directory from where the
rxcontrol file browsing starts. Then when you 'cd' to that directory,
the CD gets automatically mounted. If you set it to 5 seconds, then
when you unselect all the files from the playlist and wait for 5 seconds, 
the CD can be ejected.

For IR support, make sure lircd is running and you have enough
permissions to read+write to /dev/lircd.

You can put a message like "System halted" to be displayed in the lcd with the
lcdecho utility in  /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/S00halt
