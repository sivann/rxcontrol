lcdecho
-------

Write messages to the lcd.
For example you may add the following in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt 
just after the `echo "$message"' near the end of the script


/usr/local/bin/lcdecho /dev/lcd "Shutdown  Complete"

assuming lcdecho is installed in /usr/local/bin and /dev/lcd is the lcd
device (or a link to the appropriate serial port)
The  (Control L) is used to clear the LCD screen and can be produced in
vi by pressing ^V^L

Enjoy!
