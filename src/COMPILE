Compilation Instructions
------------------------


1) Edit file rxcontrol.conf to make appropriate changes to the paths and 
  other options.


2) You may edit rxkeys.h to change the default keys. (optional)


3) For Infra Red support (a big thanks to Bryan Mattern for the supplied 
  hardware) edit irkeys.conf. 
   At the left column you can find the definitions from rxkeys.h (description 
  is in there). 
   At the right column, the names correspond to the lircd key names (usualy 
  defined in /etc/lircd.conf). If a key from the left column doesn't have or 
  need to be used from IR, then the keyword NONE must be used instead of a 
  keyname. 
   Don't leave any blank lines in this file (for now).

4) Edit Makefile, and make appropriate changes to DFLAGS. You must comment out
   the 'HAVEIR' if you don't want infra red support or if lircd isn't running.

5) Run 'make'
