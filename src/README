About this software
-------------------
This software is used with my "MP3-O-Phono" (C) hardware, a linux based
player, without monitor or keyboard. It has a Matrix Orbital 20x4 LCD
and 9 buttons at the front. It boots from a small HD, and has a CDROM
for reading MP3 songs. The buttons are connected to the keyboard socket
of the motherboard through a chip taken by a dissasembled keyboard, so 
the input comes from stdin! This is much cheaper in money and time than
connecting a serial or parallel keypad,and it can support up to 108 keys.

COMPILING
---------
See 'COMPILE' for compiling instructions

INSTALLING
----------
See 'INSTALL' for installation procedures.

OPTIONS
-------
Running the program with '-h' gives a brief description of command-line options.

Song name format
----------------
Song must be in the following format:
"artist - song name.mp3"
or
"artist - song name - other info.mp3" 

`other info' is not displayed on the LCD.

The spaces before and after the '-' are optional.


General Operation
-----------------
There are 3 states:

	-normal
	-file selection
	-playlist editing

when the program starts and when it plays a song it is in the normal state 
For the hardware version, keyboard keys will be connected to buttons.

All keys are the default keys defined in rxkeys.h

*
* For the hardware implementation I have done, only keys marked with '*' are
* needed and used. Capital letters are implemented through a button <shift>
* so you press a combination of 2 buttons. It has the label 'All' which means
* for example that if 'v' (the stop button) erases the current entry, 'V' 
* erases all the entries, e.t.c.
*

  restart from file #1, but only if stop pressed twice (i.e. pressed when 
  already stopped) so you can continue listening from the current song by
  pressing "play" and not from the beggining.

2.playlists are saved as playlist-## where ## is a 2-digit number, in directory
  pldir defined in rxcontrol.conf


BUGS
----

None found before each release, but there are bugs. If you find bugs any please 
mail them to sivann@cs.ntua.gr. 
The 'none found' goes to rxcontrol, NOT to rxaudio which has many bugs causing 
rxcontrol to fail sometimes. I've never seen any fatal ones of them to my PC 
but the've been reported to me. Mail those to xaudio@mpegtv.com please. 


CREDITS TO
----------
-All the people who expressed themselves positively about MP3-O-Phono
-Bryan Mattern for the donnated IR hardwre. Thanks Bryan, I'd probably delay
 IR support too long without your help.
-Aaron Newsome for the bug reports.

ANTI-CREDITS TO
---------------
All the people (MANY) who said: Why bother? wait a few years and you'll buy
a commercial version. My reply to them is that when the commercial version
is out, MP3-O-Phono will be using DVD media for 18.000 minutes = 12.5 days of
continuous play per disk ;-)
